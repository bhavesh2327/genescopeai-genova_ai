## 🚨 The Problem

### Current State of Genetic Analysis:

Every day, millions of people undergo genetic testing, but interpreting DNA mutations remains one of medicine's biggest challenges:

- **⏰ Time Delays:** Current variant interpretation takes 2-4 weeks
- **💰 High Costs:** Expert analysis costs $200-500 per variant
- **🌍 Limited Access:** Advanced genomics restricted to major medical centers
- **❓ Uncertain Results:** 40-50% of variants classified as "Uncertain Significance"
- **🔄 Inconsistent Classifications:** Different labs often provide conflicting interpretations

### Real-World Impact:

```
A single nucleotide change: A → T
Location: BRCA1 gene, chromosome 17
Result: 85% increased breast cancer risk
Current wait time: 14-28 days
Our solution: <30 seconds
```

This delay can be life-threatening for patients needing immediate treatment decisions.

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT NOTICE** ⚠️

<div align="center">

> **🚨 ATTENTION: Limited Demo Credits Available on Modal.com 🚨**

</div>

<div align="center">

🚨 Our live demo is running on a limited number of free credits on Modal.com 🚨

## About "Cold Starts"
The very first analysis after a period of inactivity will experience a "cold start" and may take 40-60 seconds. This is because the serverless container needs to spin up a GPU.

Subsequent analyses will be extremely fast (2-3 seconds). Please be patient on your first try!

If the demo credits are exhausted, the API will not function. Please contact us at ayushkumr1991@gmail.com, and we will gladly provide a new endpoint. Thank you for your understanding!
